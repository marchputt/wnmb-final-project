	abstract = {Although widely touted as a replacement for glass slides and microscopes in pathology, digital slides present major challenges in data storage, transmission, processing and interoperability. Since no universal data format is in widespread use for these images today, each vendor defines its own proprietary data formats, analysis tools, viewers and software libraries. This creates issues not only for pathologists, but also for interoperability. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of {OpenSlide}\textit{,} a vendor-neutral C library for reading and manipulating digital slides of diverse vendor formats. The library is extensible and easily interfaced to various programming languages. An application written to the {OpenSlide} interface can transparently handle multiple vendor formats. {OpenSlide} is in use today by many academic and industrial organizations world-wide, including many research sites in the United States that are funded by the National Institutes of Health.},

	abstract = {Background Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ({DICOM}®) is the standard for the representation, storage, and communication of medical images and related information. A {DICOM} file format and communication protocol for pathology have been defined; however, adoption by vendors and in the field is pending. Here, we implemented the essential aspects of the standard and assessed its capabilities and limitations in a multisite, multivendor healthcare network. Methods We selected relevant {DICOM} attributes, developed a program that extracts pixel data and pixel-related metadata, integrated patient and specimen-related metadata, populated and encoded {DICOM} attributes, and stored {DICOM} files. We generated the files using image data from four vendor-specific image file formats and clinical metadata from two departments with different laboratory information systems. We validated the generated {DICOM} files using recognized {DICOM} validation tools and measured encoding, storage, and access efficiency for three image compression methods. Finally, we evaluated storing, querying, and retrieving data over the web using existing {DICOM} archive software. Results Whole slide image data can be encoded together with relevant patient and specimen-related metadata as {DICOM} objects. These objects can be accessed efficiently from files or through {RESTful} web services using existing software implementations. Performance measurements show that the choice of image compression method has a major impact on data access efficiency. For lossy compression, {JPEG} achieves the fastest compression/decompression rates. For lossless compression, {JPEG}-{LS} significantly outperforms {JPEG} 2000 with respect to data encoding and decoding speed. Conclusion Implementation of {DICOM} allows efficient access to image data as well as associated metadata. By leveraging a wealth of existing infrastructure solutions, the use of {DICOM} facilitates enterprise integration and data exchange for digital pathology.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, digital pathology and whole-slide imaging ({WSI}) have been gaining momentum with the proliferation of digital scanners from different manufacturers. The literature reports significant advantages associated with the adoption of digital images in pathology, namely, improvements in diagnostic accuracy and better support for telepathology. Moreover, it also offers new clinical and research applications. However, numerous barriers have been slowing the adoption of {WSI}, among which the most important are performance issues associated with storage and distribution of huge volumes of data, and lack of interoperability with other hospital information systems, most notably Picture Archive and Communications Systems ({PACS}) based on the {DICOM} standard. This article proposes an architecture of a Web Pathology {PACS} fully compliant with {DICOM} standard communications and data formats. The solution includes a {PACS} Archive responsible for storing whole-slide imaging data in {DICOM} {WSI} format and offers a communication interface based on the most recent {DICOM} Web services. The second component is a zero-footprint viewer that runs in any web-browser. It consumes data using the {PACS} archive standard web services. Moreover, it features a tiling engine especially suited to deal with the {WSI} image pyramids. These components were designed with special focus on efficiency and usability. The performance of our system was assessed through a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions. The results demonstrate that it is possible to have a very competitive solution based on standard workflows.},
